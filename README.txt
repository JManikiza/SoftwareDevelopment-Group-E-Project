This web application, designed collaboratively by a team of skilled developers, provides a user-friendly platform for seamless connection between patients and GPs, allowing for easy arrangement of appointments. The application features UIs for patients and GPs, all built using the .Gov Prototype kit.

To ensure smooth and efficient performance, the application was designed with two databases. The first database stores GP information and appointment schedules, while the second database stores Central Health Records. The application's sophisticated front-end to back-end connectivity ensures seamless synchronization and updates of data across both databases, resulting in real-time accuracy of information.

Overall, this web application provides a comprehensive solution for patients to find a General Practice in their area then schedule, re-arrange and cancel appointments. Admins/Receptionists can update or cancel the appointments and the Doctors can view appointments along with the notes or health records of said patient.

 The team's collaborative efforts and expertise in web development have culminated in a platform that is easy to use, efficient, and reliable.
